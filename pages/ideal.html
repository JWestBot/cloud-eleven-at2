          <p>The role is all about data collection and transformation by combining assorted groups of information into new data sets. This role appeals to me because I like to take time to organise things into their respective places and I take a
            great deal of personal and professional pride in this fact. As a government job, it also offers a lot of stability which is important as I progress my career and wish to start a family. I also have an interest in data analytics and as
            this role also draws on my previous experience in management, it’s a position I would have some comfort going into.</p>
          <p><b>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</b></p>
          <p><i>Although there is not a high demand for this role, it is still moderately sought after and as such my opinion has not changed. It is a role that will always be required in some form, especially approaching things like the Census. The
              fact that there is so much security in a government role such as thins really cements it as an ideal choice for me.</i></p>

          <p>Being a Senior Cyber Security Analyst you are responsible for monitoring security access, conducting security assessments through vulnerability testing and risk analysis. Required to perform both internal and external security audits.
          </p>
          <p>The role of Senior Cyber Security Analyst is appealing to me as you are both a part of the blue and red team when it comes to protecting and serving the community or even the country. Being a part of the Cyber Security team in a hospital
            is a very big deal as you have hundreds of lives in your hands every day, it might not seem like it but one attack can cause great chaos, panic and doubt within a community. This was definitely the case throughout the pandemic in early
            2020 having blackhat organisations attempt to steal patient information such as social security numbers in America or using ransomware to extort them and disable systems, putting patients lives at risk just for some examples. It doesn't
            have to be for St Vincent's Hospital but working as Cyber Security for the Government whether it be subcontracted or employed directly is the ideal job for me.</p>
          <p><b>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</b></p>
          <p><i>Looking at this just confirms the growth and cost cyber security has cost multiple countries over a few years and it will only increase as technology and methods improve. I have spoken with a renown cyber security expert who has given
              me an advanced guide for my pathway into an entry level position and how to further career progression which gives me the confidence needed to pursue this as a career. AI technology is the only fear I had but upon further research and
              my understanding is that “hackers” can foil the AI algorithms quite easily which will increase the threat landscape.</i></p>

          <p>A Network Administrator to responsible for the installation of hardware and software that is specific to the network of a company including servers and user management software. Network Administrators are always expected to maintain the
            network, which includes managing user accounts and fault resolution.</p>
          <p>This job appeals to me as Network Administrators are in control of every facet of a network, this is so if things go wrong, they are able to diagnose and resolve issues. The diagnoses and problem-solving aspects are what appeals to me
            the most.</p>

          <p>My ideal job in the field of IT would be a mobile app developer responsible for creating applications that make life easier. I have always been interested in becoming an iOS developer due to the high starting salary, career flexibility,
            and the fact that you can work from anywhere. The iOS developer position at Servian Pty Ltd appealed to me due to my programming background and the fact that I will be building cutting edge software. In addition to mobile development, I
            will also be working on projects involving multiple technologies from Big Data and Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, DevOps as well as numerous cloud technologies where I can learn, contribute and extend my career
            into these technologies. The role at Servian also seems like it will be a collaborative environment which I view as appealing.</p>

          </p>
          <p>The position is looking for a Cloud Engineer who wants to be part of an organization that is growing their presence in the cloud. Somebody who is both knowledgeable of existing, on premises systems but also strong with cloud products,
            services, and frameworks.</p>
          <p>The role appeals to me because the description of the role shows an organization who is looking to make innovative implementations to their business with platforms, I am both familiar with and enjoy using (currently at a basic level).
            What they are looking for is exactly what I would like to see myself doing in the future.</p>
          <p><b>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</b></p>
          <p><i>There is no identifiable shortage of Cloud Engineers currently, but there is a strong demand in the future. With this information, alongside my interest in the cloud’s capability – I have not changed the opinion of my ideal job. Cloud
              Engineers require a broad range of skills such as networking, security, designing, optimizing and more – but all cloud-associated instead of the traditional sense of these disciplines. Having worked in an MSP, I have also seen
              first-hand the benefits that incorporating the cloud to a business can be and I believe I can make a positive difference with a healthy career continuing to do this at a much bigger scale.</i></p>

            <b>Future Demand:</b> Moderate Future Demand
          </p>
          <p>The Senior Analyst - Strategy and Implementation role is a strategic roll, analysing the existing business needs, sales targets, systems and processes currently in place, working with many stakeholders including a dedicated Salesforce
            CRM team, Operations and Sales Teams and designing a Sales Pipeline and Reporting function that is fit for purpose.</p>
          <p>The possibility of leading and working on a strategic systems based project from start to finish is what I find most appealing. The role has many similarities to a User Experience Developer but with a more Business based focus. From
            scoping out the initial needs, researching and putting together a business case and proposal and then delivering the end product is the level I would like to aim for.</p>
          <p><b>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</b></p>
          <p><i>Whilst there is no shortage of Business/Business System Analysts in the current labour market, there is a moderate future demand. This outlook combined with my current skillset, the skills that I am building and with my overall
              business experience will ensure this career path has a future for me.</i></p>

      <h1>Comparative Team Analysis</h1>
      <article>
        <p>At Cloud 11 we have come together as a group from various geographic locations and backgrounds with differing levels of work experience. Each of us wanting to specialise in a different field from the next. Our group has a variety of jobs
          that we wish to persue for a future career, these jobs share many of the same skillsets.</p>
        <p>Breaking down the foundational skills groups:<br>
          <b>Digital Building Block skills</b>, these are critical skills that are required for development of IT skills. We typically build on these to create IT-Specific skills.<br>
          <b>Human skills</b>, typically referred to as soft skills. These are often overlooked but most employers will typically interview the person before they interview the programmer.<br>
          <b>Business Enabler skills</b>, are the skills that allow us to integrate our human skills and technical skills to the workplace environment.
        </p>
        <p>At Cloud 11 we have a Data Specialist and Senior Analyst looking at more frontend positions, with a heavy focus on data analysis, communicating through data visualisation and business processes. While being different on paper the core
          skills are remarkably similar with these two jobs. Both jobs work around collecting data and presenting it in an understandable manner, with their creativity and data visualisation expertise, to business stakeholders to increase efficiency
          and augment sales. As these are frontend IT positions the programming knowledge needed is limited and typically it would be statistical programming (Python, R, SQL).</p>
        <p>The other four members of the group are heavily focused on backend work. These are roles such as Cyber Security Analyst, Cloud Engineer, App Developer and Network Administrator. All these jobs are heavily focussed on backend operations
          such as digital security and privacy, networking skills, scripting, programming, and virtualisation. They also have a lot of overlapping skills in all three of the categories.</p>
        <p>IT Jobs have such an overlap in skills as the IT industry is full of hybrid jobs. Hybrid jobs are jobs that are assigned two or more roles for the job.</p>
