      <h2>Project Description</h2>

      <button class="collapsible">Overview</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>With the rapid advancement of technological need due to the pandemic and a need for real IT solutions in the Education sector, we plan to create Roll Marker: a system to mark attendance, review this data, and then subsequently see trends in students across not only individual schools, but across the whole country. Information would be kept on a school-by-school basis, which could then have all personal information retracted and be sent to the Education Department to then extrapolate this information, giving a broader insight into student attendance trends and where certain schools may need help (i.e. funding) to help increase attendance.</p>
		<p>To achieve this this, the team will work in various roles at different stages of the project as outlined later in this report. Through the creation of the project there will also need to be outside assistance sought, such as speaking with the Education Department to ensure all laws are being adhered to. By the end of this project, we aim to create a fully functional Roll Marker system that can be deployed Australia wide. One that not only offers a an easy to use, reliable attendance marking system, but also provides reliable security of students’ data and complies with each states Education Department laws and policies.</p>
		<p>With the constant growth of schools throughout Australia, being able to track student attendance becomes a greater task year on year. With the creation of Roll Marker, we plan to ease this burden for not only schools, but also for the entire Education sector by giving insight into the data of student attendance. This will help overworked teachers have one thing less to stress about, and as an application, can be accessed from home in the advent of schools not being ‘students-in-chairs’ as we have seen over the last 2 years of the pandemic. There is also the motivation to gather this information so a broader look at attendance can help schools see where there is opportunity for change.</p>
		<p>Following recent trends in Education of moving everything to technology-based systems, Roll Marker would be able to utilise one of the biggest IT buzz words of the time, cloud computing. Not only can this provide greater security for students’ data, but it is also great way for the project team to show future employers their use of a cloud-based skill set.</p>
		<p>Similar applications to the Roll Marker app do already exist, but one of the continuous setbacks of these applications is the pricing and the design. Many have what some would consider to a complicated user interface, functioning more like a spreadsheet doc than an actual application. What we want to provide is an easy program that any teacher can pick up and use without them needing to contact and expert or an IT department. The other benefit our application would bring would be that is Australian made for Australian schools. In collaboration with various states education departments, it would set it apart from any overseas model as our application would specifically adhere to required laws and practices throughout Australia.</p>

        <h4>Aims</h4>
        <p>The main aim of the project is to increase efficiencies and decrease workload across the sector for teachers and education staff Australia wide. By providing an application that simplifies a daily task and then makes it something that is easily referenced, we aim to cut down administration time for teachers and make it easier for schools to track an overall trend in student attendance. It will also be a one stop shop for teachers to access things like emergency contact information so if a student is unexpectedly absent or is having an emergency while in school, it is easy for them to contact the appropriate people. While the creation and distribution of the product is the main goal, there are further stretch goals that time permitting, ideally would be incorporated into the development of program.</p>
		<p>Our primary goal once the application has been created would be to trial the program with either select teachers, or a select group of schools. While labelled as a goal, it is almost certainly part of the main actions for the project as beta testing allows the team to receive feedback from real life education staff and then make improvements upon the program. We would survey participants to get their opinions on things like the user interface, if there any missing or redundant functions, and overall if they have any grievances with the application. Following this feedback, we would then implement what is feasible and anything that was out of reach for the timeframe would be put on the back burner, potentially for 2.0 update to the application.</p>
		<p>The secondary goal would be to explore further functionality for the program, taking it from simply roll marking software to something more robust and useful in an education environment. Features that could be added would cross many grades in schools. For younger classes, a virtual chore chart could be added, such as for when a Grade 1 class has an art day and needs to wipe down tables and wash brushes, moving forward into older grades, such as year 12 where it could track things such as test results, grade point average, exam results, and even have a feature to predict with information given how the student will grade at the end of the year, so if someone were to be headed in the wrong direction, a teacher could address it and help the student succeed.</p>
