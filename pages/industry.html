      <h1>Cloud, Services, Servers</h1>
      <h3>Jay Westfold, Cloud 11 Team Member</h3>

        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Cloud services is the delivery of information technology or computing technologies to organisations over the internet. Organisations are able to access the technology on demand and only need to pay for what they need when they need it. They are able to use Public, Private or Hybrid cloud services depending on their business needs.</p>
        <p>Through cloud services, organisations are essentially able to rent their information technology infrastructure including applications from Software as a Service (SaaS) providers, collaborative software testing and development platforms from Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers and physical or virtual servers, storage and networking from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers.</p>
        <p>A Platform as a Service product is like a sandbox on the internet, where developers or software creators can collaborate in building and testing their applications that may eventually be ready to provide to customers. A software as a service product is an application or suite of applications that is available over the internet for consumers like you or me. There might be versions of it still being constantly tweaked and improved in a PaaS environment behind the scenes, but the consumer or user sees and accesses the most up to date functioning product available. They can access it anywhere and on any device that can access the internet.</p>
        <p>Before the emergence of cloud services, organisations needed to purchase, resource, and maintain hardware on site at their places of business. In some circumstances large organisations would need to have rooms full of hardware to host all of their systems. To access those systems staff would need to be on premise. Hardware would need to be constantly maintained and upgraded to cope with the increasing processing power required due to technological advances. Cloud services allow organisations to only pay a provider for what they use, when they use it rather than pay upfront for their own infrastructure. Cloud services providers are able to provide the same services to a wide range of customers, this scalability and purchasing power allows them to provide the services at a far more economic rate than a single organisation would be able to operating on its own.</p>
        <p>Whilst the term ‘cloud computing’ has been floating around since the early 2000s the concept of renting infrastructure has been around for much longer. Due to the costs associated with owning and operating computer mainframes back in the 1960s, Universities such as MIT and Dartmouth College started offering what was known as ‘Timesharing’. This would allow users who couldn’t afford to have their own computers access to shared systems. Then came the invention of personal computers and other technological advances, but the concept of renting computing services continued. In the early 2000s Software as a Service (SaaS) really started to emerge along with hyperscale cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.</p>
        <p>Cloud computing was made possible through the discovery of virtualisation. In essence, virtualisation allows one computer to act and perform as if it was many computers. So one powerful piece of computer hardware is loaded up with a piece of software that forms a layer in-between that computer’s hardware and the Operating System/s that are running off that computer, this layer is called a hypervisor and a hypervisor can have many operating systems running on top of it as opposed to one piece of hardware running one operating system. There are two different types of hypervisors, type one is loaded on to a physical server. Type two is loaded on to an operating system on a personal computer like any other application would. This technology is then scalable and through the use of automation, many users are able access the computing power they require.</p>
        <p>Whilst it might be easy to think that cloud services means that the data and computing services you are accessing on your computer are not physically stored in any one place, it’s a little more complex than that, different organisations will have different security requirements. An Australian organisation might require their data to be stored in Australia. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers are able to make use of large data centres all across the globe, in fact <a href="https://datacentremagazine.com/top10/top-10-countries-most-data-centres" target="_blank">Data Centre Magazine [1]</a> found there were 272 data centres in Australia as at September 2021. Some are set up with their own power sources and are fully self-sufficient providing additional data security for organisations.</p>
        <h2>What is the impact?</h2>
        <p>Whilst the benefits and advantages of cloud computing will vary for every organisation, the main benefit will be around cost savings. No longer needing to buy and maintain infrastructure will present a big advantage. Organisations should be able to move faster on projects and they’ll be able to test out new strategies without committing to long term procurement as they only need to pay for what they are using.</p>
        <p>With more and more organisations turning to cloud services, there will continue to be impacts and changes to workforces and working environments. Along with cost reductions for organisations a significant amount of real estate and hardware will no longer be required in offices so there will be a reduction in the space required by organisations. Combined with the aftereffects of the recent global pandemic shifting many workplaces into work from home arrangements, city CBDs across the globe will see significant change. There is also the potential for a lot of hardware waste as old hardware is discarded or sold off. It will be important for the IT industry to look to recycling services to reduce waste and ensure the transition is sustainable. The good news is that computers and computer accessories can be recycled. In Australia the Australian Government has a National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme in place and there are state based Sustainability programs in place to assist with the ever-increasing amount of e-waste produced.</p>
        <p>Without server hardware to maintain and upgrade, roles such as Server Administrators and On-Premise Data Engineers will no longer be needed by organisations, staff will need to be upskilled to work with different technology. Cloud Administrators, Cloud Security Analysts, Cloud Network Engineers, Cloud Automaton Engineers and Cloud Consultants are now in increasing demand across many industry's.</p>
        <p>Some organisations will be hesitant to move to cloud computing. The cost of migrating in the short term can be inhibitive. Others will have security and privacy concerns when it comes to sensitive data being stored off premises.</p>
        <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
        <p>The development of cloud services is already affecting me in my current role as a Senior Analyst, Business Systems at a university. Our IT Infrastructure is already well on its way to being migrated to the cloud. Without this in place our workplace may have been more strongly affected by the global pandemic, however we were quickly able to move to working from home, online teaching and learning and with the affects of the pandemic receding, many of this will remain in place. Our university is embracing hybrid working which would not be possible if our data structures were not housed in the cloud.</p>
        <p>Through the adoption of cloud services I am able to reduce commuting times to work as I can work from home. This additional time has given me the opportunity to take on university study to build my knowledge and open new career opportunities. I no longer need to be on premise for many jobs in the IT sector. I could be working for an organisation in the United States or Europe and work from the comfort of my home in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
        <p>Having moved to a capital city from regional Australia, the continued development and adoption of cloud services may allow the opportunity to return to the regions and be closer to family. In turn cloud services could help bring further opportunities and access to healthcare and other services to regional areas with the decentralisation of workforces driving population growth.</p>
        <p>There are no doubt many unknowns with cloud computing services as there is with all emerging technologies, but there is no doubt that now that it is here, it will continue to play a part in the lives of all people across the globe.</p>
