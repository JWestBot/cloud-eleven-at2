          <p><b>Ideal Job:</b> Data Specialist<br>
          <b>Labour Market Assessment:</b> No Shortage<br>
          <b>Future Demand:</b> Moderate Future Demand</p>
          <p>The role is all about data collection and transformation by combining assorted groups of information into new data sets. This role appeals to me because I like to take time to organise things into their respective places and I take a great deal of personal and professional pride in this fact. As a government job, it also offers a lot of stability which is important as I progress my career and wish to start a family. I also have an interest in data analytics and as this role also draws on my previous experience in management, it’s a position I would have some comfort going into.</p>
          <p>Small and large businesses alike are slowly increasing the demand for data specialists to analyse data to increase efficiency within their business. Even though each business and organisation all require to have at least one data specialist within their data analysis team, this reflects why there is not as much of a shortage even though they are in demand from employers. This due to a rise in popularity for the role as majority of businesses cannot clean and visualise the data like an experienced data specialist can. This ensures their demand going forward into the future even with AI technology around the corner because this role must not only understand data, but they also need to understand the people they are working with to get the best results from presenting their data to their employers.</p>

          <p><i>Although there is not a high demand for this role, it is still moderately sought after and as such my opinion has not changed. It is a role that will always be required in some form, especially approaching things like the Census. The
              fact that there is so much security in a government role such as thins really cements it as an ideal choice for me.</i></p>

          <p><b>Ideal Job:</b> Cyber Security Analyst<br>
          <b>Labour Market Assessment:</b> Shortage<br>
          <b>Future Demand:</b> Strong Future Demand</p>
          <p>Being a Senior Cyber Security Analyst you are responsible for monitoring security access, conducting security assessments through vulnerability testing and risk analysis. Required to perform both internal and external security audits.</p>
          <p>The role of Senior Cyber Security Analyst is appealing to me as you are both a part of the blue and red team when it comes to protecting and serving the community or even the country. Being a part of the Cyber Security team in a hospital is a very big deal as you have hundreds of lives in your hands every day, it might not seem like it but one attack can cause great chaos, panic and doubt within a community. This was definitely the case throughout the pandemic in early 2020 having blackhat organisations attempt to steal patient information such as social security numbers in America or using ransomware to extort them and disable systems, putting patients lives at risk just for some examples. It doesn't have to be for St Vincent's Hospital but working as Cyber Security for the Government whether it be subcontracted or employed directly is the ideal job for me.</p>
          <p>Businesses and Organisations are becoming more aware of how important Cybersecurity is to their critical infrastructure. There is at least one cyber security analyst in a business or in some instances an entire Cybersecurity team, this creates multiple jobs for the role. Due to education requirements combined with established experience many struggle to enter the Pure-Cybersecurity space, and many get forced into hybrid jobs such as network engineer or project management which in-turn they then settle on as a career as they are highly paid regardless and do not require extensive further education and work experience. All of these are major factors of shortage in Cybersecurity jobs.</p>
          <p>With Cybersecurity already having fewer candidates than most IT jobs this only increases the demand more especially as technology evolves and we see more use of cloud computing and the Internet of Things the demand for Cybersecurity Analysts will only grow.</p>

          <p>A Network Administrator to responsible for the installation of hardware and software that is specific to the network of a company including servers and user management software. Network Administrators are always expected to maintain the network, which includes managing user accounts and fault resolution.</p>
          <p>This job appeals to me as Network Administrators are in control of every facet of a network, this is so if things go wrong, they are able to diagnose and resolve issues. The diagnoses and problem-solving aspects are what appeals to me the most.</p>
          <p>The Network resides within the heart of the business, this is the digital infrastructure that keeps the everything talking to each other and has become vital to business operations in the modern era. Network administrators require to work with both hardware and software of the computers, but also people. As many other roles such as Cybersecurity or Cloud engineering require a lot of skills a Network Admin has, this becomes a steppingstone for many looking to get into those two sectors, which means many people are taught the digital building blocks to become a Network Administrator... this however does not reflect in how demand the job is.</p>
          <p>As technology develops businesses and organisations are continually investing in hardware and software that requires installation and updates on the regular. Network administrators require such a diverse skill set that not everyone can meet. </p>

          </p>
          <p>My ideal job in the field of IT would be a mobile app developer responsible for creating applications that make life easier. I have always been interested in becoming an iOS developer due to the high starting salary, career flexibility, and the fact that you can work from anywhere. The iOS developer position at Servian Pty Ltd appealed to me due to my programming background and the fact that I will be building cutting edge software. In addition to mobile development, I will also be working on projects involving multiple technologies from Big Data and Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, DevOps as well as numerous cloud technologies where I can learn, contribute and extend my career into these technologies. The role at Servian also seems like it will be a collaborative environment which I view as appealing.</p>
          <p>To create a mobile application, you typically need an app developer but in many cases a team of app developers. Typically, an App developer would be extremely ambitious, intelligent, and possess a creative mind with wide set of technical skills to match. The combination of human skills, digital building blocks and business enablers all create a shortage in the industry.</p>
          <p>Mobile applications and the technology that uses it are forever evolving and diverse types of applications are always needed which create a high demand, going back to 2020, at the start of the pandemic applications like Zoom or Skype were in such high demand and each year there will always be someone new to be made, and not every app developer as the creativity or vision to create every type of app, that is why some specialise in games, others in business applications, some with cloud applications etc. This pushes the demand in the entire industry as not everyone wants to create every type of application.</p>

          <p><b>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</b></p>
          <p><i>After reviewing the Burning Glass data, which was captured 4 years ago, it has shown me that there is high demand for software developers. Furthermore, in recent years there has been an increase in demand for software engineers and programmers who have skills in JavaScript, project management, and graphic design. With this new knowledge my opinion of my ideal job has not changed. I will need to learn a broad range of skills (such as learning a variety of programming languages, business skills, and mobile design), however, I will also need to specialise in skills that are currently in high demand to expand my portfolio.</i></p>

          <p>The position is looking for a Cloud Engineer who wants to be part of an organization that is growing their presence in the cloud. Somebody who is both knowledgeable of existing, on premises systems but also strong with cloud products, services, and frameworks.</p>
          <p>The role appeals to me because the description of the role shows an organization who is looking to make innovative implementations to their business with platforms, I am both familiar with and enjoy using (currently at a basic level). What they are looking for is exactly what I would like to see myself doing in the future.</p>
          <p>The Cloud is a fast-growing in adoption to businesses as there is clear data backing up its cost-effectiveness and business scalability. But as more businesses adopt cloud technology the demand will only grow for Cloud engineers and secure their future within the IT industry. Currently the need for a Cloud engineer is limited mostly because the cloud and the technologies they use is so new, the technical skills required to effectively engineer networks and scale business are still being learned by many, but as these technologies refine and become more mainstream, the demand for Cloud engineers to implement solutions will increase which will create a major shortage in the Cloud engineering space.</p>

              Engineers require a broad range of skills such as networking, security, designing, optimizing and more – but all cloud-associated instead of the traditional sense of these disciplines. Having worked in an MSP, I have also seen
              first-hand the benefits that incorporating the cloud to a business can be and I believe I can make a positive difference with a healthy career continuing to do this at a much bigger scale.</i></p>

          </p>
          <p>The Senior Analyst - Strategy and Implementation role is a strategic roll, analysing the existing business needs, sales targets, systems and processes currently in place, working with many stakeholders including a dedicated Salesforce CRM team, Operations and Sales Teams and designing a Sales Pipeline and Reporting function that is fit for purpose.</p>
          <p>Creating strategy and implementation by analysing the existing business needs, sales targets, systems, and processes in a business it typically handled by a Senior Analyst. Businesses have been using these type of Analysts for years already whether it is just for raw data, logistics, sales analysis, statistics etc... All these different analytical jobs are branched out from being a data analyst. With having lower demand for digital building blocks but relying on many human skills and business enabler skills, this role much like the others will always be in demand.</p>
          <p>The possibility of leading and working on a strategic systems based project from start to finish is what I find most appealing. The role has many similarities to a User Experience Developer but with a more Business based focus. From
            scoping out the initial needs, researching and putting together a business case and proposal and then delivering the end product is the level I would like to aim for.</p>

      <h1>Comparative Team Analysis</h1>
      <article>
        <p>At Cloud 11 we have come together as a group each wanting to specialise in a different field from the next. Our group has a variety of jobs we all wish to peruse for a career in the future, a lot of which have many of the same skillsets. Jack and Jay wanting to specialise in analysing and manipulating data for employers. Kurt, Marco-Antonio, and Matthew all want to work in advanced areas of computing where you need to understand the critical digital infrastructure in their respective fields. Lastly Mason is wanting to become an app developer, where this role does need to understand computing, they do specialise in creation and design of mobile applications using their preferred programming language.</p>
        <p>Data specialists and Senior analysts share the many of the foundational skills of digital building blocks, these typically statistical programming languages and other office applications. The core programming languages used are Python, R and SQL, these allow analysts to compare data sets at a large scale with the use of algorithms and machine learning. All this raw data is useless without creating a visualisation that is easy to read and understand for their employer, this is where the use of Microsoft 365 (Excel, PowerPoint, Word), PowerBI and Salesforce come into play.</p>
        <p>Network Administrators are primarily built upon the digital building blocks of digital security, network administration and management, hardware management, system administration and virtualisation. Being a Network Administrator means to be an expert of both digital and physical infrastructure of their employer with the type of operating systems used at business. They tend to specialise in programming languages like Python, PERL and TCL.</p>
        <p>Cloud Engineers and Cyber Security Analysts are built the same foundational skills of digital security, networking, and virtualisation but need to know not only how a network works but also be experts in their retrospective field. Cloud Engineers for instance will have a wide range of programming languages at their disposal such as .NET, Golong, PHP, Python and SQL. They also need to completely understand cloud computing and infrastructure, all the different cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure and GoogleGo, while improving their digital security skills to fit their role typically with blockchain, cloud and mobile operating system security. Cyber Security Analysts need to understand the foundations of both roles but have a more advanced knowledge of all operating systems along with a vast knowledge of programming languages like C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell and Python. Understanding a large variety of programming languages compliments the role further allowing them to work on a wide range of projects with any type of security asset.</p>
        <p>App Developers while specialising in being software developers with a passion for creation of mobile applications they still need to have a complete understanding of how to use a computer much like any other IT role as applications typically developed using these programming languages Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift, C#. With the advance in windows and now being able to code with Swift (used to create iOS applications) App developers are free to use whatever device has their preferred operating system. Having a complete understanding of cloud computing, networks and operating systems allows for a lot more functionality with apps as technology is evolving customers and employers are excepting more features such as complete cross-platform capabilities, cloud storage for files or game saves and an easy-to-use user interface and better user experience.</p>
        <p>Whether you want to be a Data Specialist, Senior Analyst, Network Administrator, Cloud Engineer, Cyber Security Analyst or even an App Developer all of these require a broad range of required skills, whether that be digital building blocks, human skills or business enabling skills.</p>
