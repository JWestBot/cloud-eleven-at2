        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Cloud services is the delivery of information technology or computing technologies to organisations over the internet. Organisations are able to access the technology on demand and only need to pay for what they need when they need it. They are able to use Public, Private or Hybrid cloud services depending on their business needs.</p>
        <p>Through cloud services, organisations are essentially able to rent their information technology infrastructure including applications from Software as a Service (SaaS) providers, collaborative software testing and development platforms from Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers and physical or virtual servers, storage and networking from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers.</p>
        <p>A Platform as a Service product is like a sandbox on the internet, where developers or software creators can collaborate in building and testing their applications that may eventually be ready to provide to customers. A software as a service product is an application or suite of applications that is available over the internet for consumers like you or me. There might be versions of it still being constantly tweaked and improved in a PaaS environment behind the scenes, but the consumer or user sees and accesses the most up to date functioning product available. They can access it anywhere and on any device that can access the internet.</p>
        <p>Before the emergence of cloud services, organisations needed to purchase, resource, and maintain hardware on site at their places of business. In some circumstances large organisations would need to have rooms full of hardware to host all of their systems. To access those systems staff would need to be on premise. Hardware would need to be constantly maintained and upgraded to cope with the increasing processing power required due to technological advances. Cloud services allow organisations to only pay a provider for what they use, when they use it rather than pay upfront for their own infrastructure. Cloud services providers are able to provide the same services to a wide range of customers, this scalability and purchasing power allows them to provide the services at a far more economic rate than a single organisation would be able to operating on its own.</p>
        <p>Whilst the term ‘cloud computing’ has been floating around since the early 2000s the concept of renting infrastructure has been around for much longer. Due to the costs associated with owning and operating computer mainframes back in the 1960s, Universities such as MIT and Dartmouth College started offering what was known as ‘Timesharing’. This would allow users who couldn’t afford to have their own computers access to shared systems. Then came the invention of personal computers and other technological advances, but the concept of renting computing services continued. In the early 2000s Software as a Service (SaaS) really started to emerge along with hyperscale cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.</p>
        <p>Cloud computing was made possible through the discovery of virtualisation. In essence, virtualisation allows one computer to act and perform as if it was many computers. So one powerful piece of computer hardware is loaded up with a piece of software that forms a layer in-between that computer’s hardware and the Operating System/s that are running off that computer, this layer is called a hypervisor and a hypervisor can have many operating systems running on top of it as opposed to one piece of hardware running one operating system. There are two different types of hypervisors, type one is loaded on to a physical server. Type two is loaded on to an operating system on a personal computer like any other application would. This technology is then scalable and through the use of automation, many users are able access the computing power they require.</p>
        <p>Whilst it might be easy to think that cloud services means that the data and computing services you are accessing on your computer are not physically stored in any one place, it’s a little more complex than that, different organisations will have different security requirements. An Australian organisation might require their data to be stored in Australia. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers are able to make use of large data centres all across the globe, in fact <a href="https://datacentremagazine.com/top10/top-10-countries-most-data-centres" target="_blank">Data Centre Magazine [1]</a> found there were 272 data centres in Australia as at September 2021. Some are set up with their own power sources and are fully self-sufficient providing additional data security for organisations.</p>
        <h2>What is the impact?</h2>
        <p>Whilst the benefits and advantages of cloud computing will vary for every organisation, the main benefit will be around cost savings. No longer needing to buy and maintain infrastructure will present a big advantage. Organisations should be able to move faster on projects and they’ll be able to test out new strategies without committing to long term procurement as they only need to pay for what they are using.</p>
        <p>With more and more organisations turning to cloud services, there will continue to be impacts and changes to workforces and working environments. Along with cost reductions for organisations a significant amount of real estate and hardware will no longer be required in offices so there will be a reduction in the space required by organisations. Combined with the aftereffects of the recent global pandemic shifting many workplaces into work from home arrangements, city CBDs across the globe will see significant change. There is also the potential for a lot of hardware waste as old hardware is discarded or sold off. It will be important for the IT industry to look to recycling services to reduce waste and ensure the transition is sustainable. The good news is that computers and computer accessories can be recycled. In Australia the Australian Government has a National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme in place and there are state based Sustainability programs in place to assist with the ever-increasing amount of e-waste produced.</p>
        <p>Without server hardware to maintain and upgrade, roles such as Server Administrators and On-Premise Data Engineers will no longer be needed by organisations, staff will need to be upskilled to work with different technology. Cloud Administrators, Cloud Security Analysts, Cloud Network Engineers, Cloud Automaton Engineers and Cloud Consultants are now in increasing demand across many industry's.</p>
        <p>Some organisations will be hesitant to move to cloud computing. The cost of migrating in the short term can be inhibitive. Others will have security and privacy concerns when it comes to sensitive data being stored off premises.</p>
        <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
        <p>The development of cloud services is already affecting me in my current role as a Senior Analyst, Business Systems at a university. Our IT Infrastructure is already well on its way to being migrated to the cloud. Without this in place our workplace may have been more strongly affected by the global pandemic, however we were quickly able to move to working from home, online teaching and learning and with the affects of the pandemic receding, many of this will remain in place. Our university is embracing hybrid working which would not be possible if our data structures were not housed in the cloud.</p>
        <p>Through the adoption of cloud services I am able to reduce commuting times to work as I can work from home. This additional time has given me the opportunity to take on university study to build my knowledge and open new career opportunities. I no longer need to be on premise for many jobs in the IT sector. I could be working for an organisation in the United States or Europe and work from the comfort of my home in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
        <p>Having moved to a capital city from regional Australia, the continued development and adoption of cloud services may allow the opportunity to return to the regions and be closer to family. In turn cloud services could help bring further opportunities and access to healthcare and other services to regional areas with the decentralisation of workforces driving population growth.</p>
        <p>There are no doubt many unknowns with cloud computing services as there is with all emerging technologies, but there is no doubt that now that it is here, it will continue to play a part in the lives of all people across the globe.</p>

      <article>
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the field of protecting information systems from threats and attacks. These information systems include computers, servers, Information of Things (IoT) devices, mobile phones and network infrastructure. As information technology improves and the world is getting more connected than ever before, the threat landscape for organizations and individuals using these information systems is also growing. Particularly those systems which are connected on the same networks, especially those on the Internet.</p>
        <p>A market overview provided by <i>CompTIA</i> (2021), a well-known name in the cybersecurity space for certifying security professionals, show concerning statistics regarding threats which can be mitigated with better cybersecurity:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Average cost of a data breach | $4.24 million</li>
          <li>Average number of days to identify and contain a data breach | 287</li>
          <li>Number of new malware programs found per day | 350K</li>
          <li>Average cost of remediating a ransomware attack | $1.85 million</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A key development in the state of the art of Cybersecurity is the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence with cybersecurity prevention and detection software. Challenges of analyzing large scale data sets and behaviors on information systems are being overcome with the use artificial intelligence and machine learning to keep up with the fast evolving and unique attacks.</p>
        <p>An example of a prevalent style of attack seen in cybersecurity is the use of phishing and spear phishing campaigns (a type of phishing where phishing communications are curated for the specific targe individual or organization). A user may be sent an email from what looks like a trusted organization, or their own organization, requesting personal or critical information (such as credentials or payment information). Once the user divulges the information to the attacker, a ripple of effects which can quickly get out of control resulting in serious disruption and damages can occur. Improved detection and prevention methods in software/services from AI and machine learning are mitigating these attacks, proving to be highly effective. </p>
        <p>A guide by <i>Deloitte</i> (2016) clearly lays out what can be done by organizations (and really, individuals too) to establish a strong cybersecurity posture. It is summarized well in 5 points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Know your crown jewels and understand friends’ roles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understand what valuable information in your network is and understand how 3rd parties of your valuable information are connected. Does a third-party organization have too much access to information that they shouldn’t have? </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Proactively assess your cyber risk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As your organization grows and develops over time, ensure that regular cyber risk assessments are made to reflect the changes from growth and development. Adopt cyber threat intelligence capabilities with external and internal intelligence.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make awareness a priority</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ensure that everybody in the organization has cybersecurity awareness as a habit. Keep the topic of maintaining integrity and security in a user -friendly manner as part of the organization’s operations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fortify your organization</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Minimize vulnerabilities in the organization. Keep software and systems security up to date. Identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can hinder cybersecurity and improve them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prepare for the inevitable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Have a plan for managing incidents that result in a breach of cybersecurity. Simulate instances which keep the organization prepared on how to act.</p>
        <h2>What is the impact?</h2>
        <p>The development of cybersecurity would result in information systems functioning safer and as-intended, with less threats being able to compromise data, disrupt networks and damage individuals or organizations. This doesn’t mean that users of the information systems should act any less secure, as a significant component of cybersecurity is the ability of the users of the information systems to remain secure with good habits. With less breaches and compromise, greater levels of innovation would come from businesses having confidence with information systems. </p>
        <p>Aside from there being positive benefits to cybersecurity improvements, attackers and bad actors will also improve resulting in more unique and advanced attack styles. Cybersecurity specialists would have further granular roles, specializing in areas of cybersecurity as opposed to cybersecurity. Smaller and mid-sized organizations would have to further rely on service-providers to feasibly defend themselves within budget as the attack vector becomes more overwhelming with advanced attacks. Individuals and consumers would be more reliant on their platforms/OS of choice to have inherently secure designs.</p>
        <p>This will create significantly more jobs as we can see in the current economic climate and forecasts. As described above, there will be a need for cybersecurity professionals with varying specialties in their field, whether that be network security, application security, physical security, or social engineering prevention training. </p>
        <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
        <p>I will constantly make sure that I am adopting cybersecurity best practices throughout my daily life to minimize any potential breaches to my important accounts and information. Ensuring that security updates to my operating system and software are done periodically. Using a password manager and unique passwords for each individual account/system. Enabling multi-factor authentication where possible. </p>
        <p>I also would be looking out for my family and friends who may be vulnerable by simply not knowing how, or not knowing the significance of having a strong cybersecurity posture. Recommending the above-mentioned good security practices that can be employed to prevent any disasters from occurring.</p>
        <p>Not much would be different for me, other than constantly adapting to best cybersecurity practices at the time they are implemented. The most important difference for me is that as an IT professional aware of the issues that can come about with poor cybersecurity, it is important to keep our fellow vulnerable population aware of the consequences and solutions. Not only can a breach be devastating for the individual themselves, it can also ripple into our lives directly while the attacker is looking to move laterally.</p>
